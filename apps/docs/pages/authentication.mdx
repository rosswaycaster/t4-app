# ðŸ”’ Authentication - Clerk

T4 uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) for authentication

## ðŸ”­ Overview

The authentication flow in T4 involves the following steps:

1. User Registration: Users can register their accounts using Supabase's email authentication
   or sign in directly through various third-party providers such as Google, Apple, and Discord.
   This allows users to choose their preferred method for signing up.

2. Email Verification: After registering, users receive an email to verify their email address.
   They need to click on the verification link to confirm their account.

3. User Login: Once registered and verified, users can log in to T4 using Supabase's email authentication
   or directly through third-party providers.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Once a user is authenticated, T4 utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
to manage and maintain user sessions. The JWT contains encoded information about the
user's identity and authentication details. This token is securely stored on the
client side (e.g., in secure storage or cookies) and sent with each request to
authenticate and authorize the user's access to protected resources.

Authorization and Access Control: Along with authentication, T4 implements authorization and
access control mechanisms. This includes managing user roles, permissions, and restrictions
to ensure appropriate access to specific resources or features based on the user's privileges.
This is handled through [PostgreSQL's Row Level Security (RLS).](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html)
